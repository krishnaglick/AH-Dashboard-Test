<p>actionhero is a <a href="http://nodejs.org">node.js</a> <strong>API framework</strong> for both <strong>tcp sockets</strong>, <strong>web sockets</strong>, and <strong>http clients</strong>.  The goal of actionhero is to create an easy-to-use toolkit for making <strong>reusable</strong> &amp; <strong>scalable</strong> APIs.  Clients connected to an actionhero server can <strong>consume the api</strong>, <strong>consume static content</strong>, and <strong>communicate with each other</strong>.</p>

<p>actionhero servers can process both requests and tasks (delayed actions like <code class="prettyprint">send e-mail</code> or other background jobs).  actionhero servers can also run in a cluster (on the same or multiple machines) to work in concert to handle your load.</p>

<p>The actionhero API defines a single access point and accepts GET, POST, PUT and DELETE input along with persistent connection via TCP or web sockets. You define <strong>Actions</strong> which handle input and response, such as <code class="prettyprint">userAdd</code> or <code class="prettyprint">geoLocate</code>. HTTP, HTTPS, and TCP clients can all use these actions.  The actionhero API is not inherently &ldquo;RESTful&rdquo; (which is meaningless for persistent socket connections) but can be extended to be so if you wish.</p>

<p>actionhero will also serve static files for you, but actionhero is not a &lsquo;rendering&rsquo; server (like express or rails).</p>

<h2 id="documentation-notes">Documentation Notes</h2>

<p>This documentation will always reflect the master branch of actionhero, and therefore may be slightly ahead of the latest release on NPM.</p>
